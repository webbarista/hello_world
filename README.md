# hello_world
my first foray into github as I embark on my webdev journey
having first ventured into programming back in 1982 on an Altair 8080 computer wher code was entered via 8 toglle switches on the front panel.  From there, a bit of Basic programming on the Apple II prior to being introduced to structured programming concepts in college in a class on Pascal (feel free to say "huh?" at this point).
