# hello_world
my first foray into github as I embark on my webdev journey.

	Having first ventured into programming back in 1982 on an Altair 8080 computer where code was entered via 8 toggle switches on the front panel.  From there, a bit of Basic programming on the Apple II prior to being introduced to structured programming concepts in college in a class on Pascal (feel free to say "huh?" at this point).
	Fast forward 30 years, many of which were spent in audio engineering, and now I am eager to get my skillz up to date with the hopes of embarking on a second career in web development
